## Installation:
The buildozer tool can be used to build the app, or the android apk in the bin can be installed directly.


## About the App:
fourbar is a multitouch app simulating a four a bar linkage. This app allows one to examine the motion of any four-bar
linkage that satisfies Grashof's condition.  The condition simply states that if sum of the longest and shortest members
of a four bar linkage are less than the sum of the other two, the smallest member can make a full rotation with respect
it's neighbor. When this condition is satisfied, the app will at a constantly velocity rotate the smallest member.  This
leads to some interesting mechanical behaviors that are difficult to express from a book or in a lecture setting.  The
app is also not math heavy.  Rather learning is accomplished through observation and experimentation.  While the app is
aimed more at engineering students, I think others will find it interesting if not peek someones interest in the phsical
sciences.

The app itself is themed after the green tinted graphing paper usually used to make technical drawings.  I like how you
can hide most of the widgets and it looks like you are just working on a piece of graph paper.  The four-bar sits in a 2D
scroll so it can be easily moved to compare the motion to the graphs or get access to the motion controls on the
sidebar.  I made sure it worked in both landscape and portrait for an android tablet, but I don't think it will look that
great on smaller devices like phones.
